       <b> Data science</b> is an interdisciplinary academic field <sup>[1]</sup> that uses statistics, <mark> scientific computing</mark>, <del> scientific methods</del>, processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data.[2]

Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).[3] Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.[4]

    <p> <b> <mark> <u>Data science is "a concept to unify statistics, data analysis,</u> </mark> </b> informatics, and their related methods" to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[5] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.[6] However, data science is different from computer science and information science.
 Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.[7][8]
<br><br>
A data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to summarize data.[9]</p>
